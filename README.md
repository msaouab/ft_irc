# Desciption

 - Internet Relay Chator IRC is a text-based communication protocol on the Internet.It offers real-time messaging that can be either public or private. Users can exchangedirect messages and join group channels.IRC clients connect to IRC servers in order to join channels. IRC servers are connected together to form a network.2

# Summary:
	- This project is about creating your own IRC server.You will use an actual IRC client to connect to your server and test it.
	- Internet is ruled by solid standards protocols that allow connected computers to interactwith each other.
	- Itâ€™s always a good thing to know.Version: 6

## Mandatory part
 - We have to develop an IRC server in C++ 98.
 - The server must be capable of handling multiple clients at the same time and never hang.
 - Only 1 poll() (or equivalent) can be used for handling all these operations (read, write, but also listen, and so forth).
 - An IRC client must be able to connect to your server without encountering any error.
 - Communication between client and server has to be done via TCP/IP (v4).
 - Using the IRC client with our server must be similar to using it with any official IRC server. However, we only have to implement the following features:
	-	We must be able to authenticate, set a nickname, a username, join a channel, send and receive private messages using the IRC client.
	- All the messages sent from one client to a channel have to be forwarded to every other client that joined the channel.
	- We must have operators and regular users.
	- Then, we have to implement the commands that are specific to operators.

## Bonus part

 - Here are the extra features we added to our IRC server so it looks even more like and actual IRC server:
	- Handle file transfer.
	- Add a bot.
